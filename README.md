# My Personal Website
## Now live at https://www.Alueroa.me
First attempt at creating a personal website. First version of the website is using a free template taken from [Colorlib](https://colorlib.com) licensed under Creative Commons 3.0. Fairly straight forward to use so far, even taking into account my essentially nonexistant Web Development skills. 

## Built With

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - The web framework used
* [Sublime Text Editor](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) - For quick edits or easy side by side comparisons.
* [Coffee](https://www.deathwishcoffee.com/) - My doctor told me to stop drinking coffee, but it's clearly necessary to the creative process.
